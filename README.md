## Budgeting Application

###### Raymond Hung, Viper - y8i2b


This application will help users properly manage their money based on their monthly income (**budget**). 
The intended users are *university students*, young adults or anyone looking to better manage their money to 
avoid going broke. This project is of particular interest to me as I find myself constantly thinking things I need to
pay off, such as bills, groceries, rent, hobby items, etc. Having this application consolidate all those items into
once place will help me better visualize my spending and reallocate how I spend if necessary.

#### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to create my own spending categories and add items
- As a user, I want to be able to view my spending categories and amount spent in each
